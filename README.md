## Objective- To predict the age in years based on number of rings predicted based on different attributes as a measurement units. 

## Data Set Information:
•	Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. 

•	The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.

•	Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

•	Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem

•	Dataset consists of 4177 instances with 8 attributes.

##  Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description 
1.	Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant) 
2.	Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement 
3.	Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length 
4.	Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell 
5.	Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone 
6.	Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat 
7.	Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding) 
8.	Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried 
9.	Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
